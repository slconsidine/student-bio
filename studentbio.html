    <p>Hi everyone! My name is Samantha Considine and I usually go by Sam. I have lived in South Jersey my whole life
        and currently live in Runnemede. I work at the University of Penn as an Audiovisual Technician for Wharton
        Computing. Even though I already work in the IT industry, I am really looking forward to expanding my skills
        with this bootcamp.</p>
    <p>I am an avid Philadelphia sports fan especially for the Eagles and the Flyers. I love to cook and try new recipes
        in my spare time. I have two cats named Pickle and Beans (that's Pickle in the picture above).</p>
